# USE CASE 4 - SASE Pulse Delivery Analysis

## Abstract

An analysis workflow implemented to a Jupyter notebook was used to look at XGM
(X-ray Gas Monitor) data that were recorded in the same time interval, but in
different parts of European XFEL. It essence, pulse energy (intensity) values
from one XGM in SASE1 were compared to another set from an XGM in SASE3. These
data stem from alternating X-ray pulses sent through one or the other tunnel and
recorded separately. The aim was to determine the suppression rate for intensity
from unwanted residual photons in each "non-pulse" time interval.

Conceptually and technically, this analysis makes use of the data-object
xarray.DataArray within the EXtra-data framework and implements a simple form of
error propagation. It is already public as example notebook in the EXtra-data
documentation: https://extra-data.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xpd_examples2.html,
and could be of value to PaNOSC due to its transferability to the general case
of data comparison and/or error determination.

## Disclaimer

The example as shown has no reasonable physical accuracy, because - due to the
lack of dynamic range of the XGM - the individual uncertainties of suppressed
pulses are more than double the magnitude of the signal itself.

Individual uncertainties are not available in the stored data from this
experiment, in the first place. The derived standard deviation of the mean has
no meaning for suppressed data due to the intrinsic noise level dominating the
signal, and thus also the ratio of suppression becomes meaningless.

In conclusion, this example has a conceptual value in explaining on how such
analysis could be performed, in theory, with a different XGM specification. It
should however not be seen as real-life data analysis.
